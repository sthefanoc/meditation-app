# Meditation React App

A medition website in which the user can choose for how long he will meditatate and what kind of background he wants (beach sounds or rain sounds).

## Getting Started

To get this running on another machine, just clone the repo and run the command to start the server:
```
npm start
```

No external libraries were used. The media files for the project are inside the "assets" page, inside "src".



### Styles

The website is responsive. Using media-queries the app can be used on desktop or smaller screens.

The app is deployed on gh-pages. To make this work, it's necessary to install the npm package and add two scripts on "package.json" file.
### Install gh-pages
```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```
### Scritps to add to package.json
```

"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
```
